# üéì University Examination System Database

This project implements a **relational database schema** for managing a University Examination System. It covers core components such as **students**, **faculty members**, **departments**, **courses**, **exams**, and **exam attempts**. The schema ensures all key relationships are captured, including course enrollments, exam creation, coordination, teaching assignments, and student performance tracking.

## üîç Key Features

- Faculty members can act as department heads, course coordinators, and exam creators.
- Each student is enrolled in a department and can take multiple courses.
- Course enrollments include attendance tracking.
- Exams are tied to courses and created by faculty.
- Each student may have multiple attempts per exam with marks and dates recorded.
- Real-world academic roles and relationships reflected using foreign keys.
